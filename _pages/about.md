I'm a doctorial student from [IIE](http://www.iie.cas.cn/), [UCAS](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/). My research interest includes the security of Cloud Native, virtualization and operating systems.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiaoqi Jia](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~xiaoqi) of Cyber Space Security Evaluation Lab from [Institue of Information Engineering](http://www.iie.cas.cn/), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. 

You can find my CV here: [Shaowen's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf). And the Chinese Version is hear: [Chinese CV](../assets/CV_Chinese.pdf)
